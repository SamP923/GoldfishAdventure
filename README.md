# Video-Game_GoldfishAdventure
A 2D platformer where the player collects potions and jumps on platforms to get to the flag at the end.
My first experimentation with 2D platformer physics. Made with Unity for Game Design 2019.

## Controls
WASD to move, space to jump.

## Gameplay
The player, a goldfish, is in a cityscape and must jump on platforms to get the a waving flag at the end.
They can also collect three blue potions on the way, which are randomized to different placements. A player wins by reaching the flag.

## How to Play
You can download and play the game by downloading the zip file <code>adventure.zip</code>. Extract the files to a folder.
The <code>GoldfishAdventure_Data</code> folder and <code>GoldfishAdventure.exe</code> need to be in the same folder in order to run. Run the executable.

## Expansions
In the future, I would like to expand this project to make a full-fleshed game, as well as work more with the platformer physics.
1. Make the movement less "slippery."
2. Add more levels with a progression (and increased difficulty).
3. Add some sort of storyline behind levels and chosen game elements.
4. Create a level-picker from the home menu.
5. Add some sort of obstacle where the player can die and respawn (spikes?).
6. Improve the platform sprites.
